   ANSWERS

1. *Augmented Intelligence (AI) vs. Artificial Intelligence (AI):*

*A. According to definitions:*

- *Augmented Intelligence (AI):* Augmented Intelligence refers to the use of technology to enhance and complement human intelligence, decision-making, and problem-solving capabilities. It focuses on collaboration between humans and machines, where the technology assists humans in making better decisions rather than replacing them.

- *Artificial Intelligence (AI):* Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and perception. AI systems can operate autonomously, often without human intervention.

*B. According to purpose:*

- *Augmented Intelligence:* The primary goal is to empower humans by providing tools and insights that improve their decision-making and efficiency. It emphasizes human-machine collaboration.
